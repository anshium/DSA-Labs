In today's lab you need to implement 5 sorting algorithms and have a comparative study between them:
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort 
- Heap Sort
  
  
For each sorting algorithm you implement in functions.c, uncomment only that function call in main.c and run following command:
- `gcc -g functions.c main.c`
- `./a.out < input.txt > {algorithm_name}.txt`

To plot the comparative graph between the algorithms you implemented use following command:

>`python3 plot.py {algorithm_name_1}.txt {algorithm_name_2}.txt {algorithm_name_3}.txt {algorithm_name_4}.txt {algorithm_name_5}.txt`

> Note: These algorithm names must be the same which you used while running those algorithms using ./a.out.
